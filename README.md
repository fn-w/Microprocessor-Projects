# Digital-code-lock-arduino
Security is a major concern in our day to day life, and Digital Locks have become an important part of these security systems.
There are many types of technologies available for security purpose but our purpose is to provide a digitally password based security system with keypad using Arduino Uno.
It will open your door only when the right password is entered and it will start beeping when a wrong password is entered.
The aim of the project of “Arduino based password protected locking system” can be used to provide enough security in various places like bank lockers, security doors, BIOS locking in computer etc.
This project is effective in providing enough security as long as the password is not shared. In future this “Arduino based password security locking system” can be provided maximum security by the above enhancements in order to completely satisfy user’s needs.
Hence, a common man can afford to purchase such locking system in minimal cost to keep his valuables safely without any worries.

Line following Robot project aims to implement the algorithm and control the movement of robot by proper tuning of the control parameters and thus achieve better performance.
These robots can be used as automated equipment carriers in industries replacing traditional conveyer belts.
These robots can also be used as automatic cars running on roads with embedded magnets.
These can also be used at homes for domestic purposes like floor cleaning etc.
These can be used in public places like shopping malls, museums etc. to provide path guidance.
